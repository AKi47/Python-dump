[Player]:Howdy. Are you the harbour master?
Harbour Master:Sure I am, what do you need traveler?
[Player]:Someone mentioned this town beng raided, what is that about?
Harbour Master:Well, there is a mountain to the north east that is a camp for all sorts of monsters that continually raids our humble town.
Harbour Master:Thankfully we have a protector that helps us fight them back but he will not leave this unguarded to possible deal with them.
Harbour Master:You seem to be able to take care of yourself, am I correct in assuming so? 
[Player]:Well I would like to think I am.
Harbour Master:Excellent! How about you go clear out the camp and when you return I will pay you handsomely?
[Player]:That sounds fair, I will be off them.
